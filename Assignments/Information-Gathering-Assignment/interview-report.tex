\begin{enumerate}
    \item What do you expect the system to output in the generated reports?
    \item How do you think the system will help you to solve current managerial problems?
    \item To what degree would you assess the sensitivity of the data used?
    \item What additional features would you like to see in the system?
    \item Should the interface contain a dashboard of the most important data?
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Pyramid type questions}
The Pyramid type questions are going to be suitable for an admin interview as we need identify intended usage of the systems by the admin, and the interview expands by asking questions about  expected usage of the system.

Admin:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Should the system include a data management subsystem?
    \item Should the system include a review capability of the reports produced before being finalized?
    \item What is your main concern about the analysis of data in the system?
    \item What are the possible issues that you might face during the administration of the system?
    \item What are your thoughts about the interface that is going to be used in the data management subsystem?

    \item Should the reports produced by the system include projection of revenue gain and possible losses?
    \item What finical performance metrics do you expect to be included in produced reports?
    \item Do you think the systems might help with identifying finical trends?
    \item How often should the finical reports be produced or updated in the system?
    \item Should the ability to display different currencies and conversion capability?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Structure of the interview}
\textbf{The Interview is going to be semi-Structured to allow follow-up questions that elaborate more on the answers.}

\section{Report of The Simulated Interviews}
\subsection{The First interview (Users)}
\subsubsection{Interviewee}
\textbf{Users: Mid to Higher management}
\subsubsection{Interviewer}
\textbf{Shahd Ahmed}
\subsubsection{Purpose of the Interview}
The purpose of it is the collection more information about the requirements of the interface subsystem as well as the reporting subsystem in the aspects of clarity and simplicity.
\subsubsection{Interview}

\textbf{Question:} What do you expect the system to output in the generated reports?

\textbf{Answer:} I expect the reports to contain a breakdown of data, giving useful information that I can use to make different decision, as well as a visual breakdown as that is going to be more beneficial. Moreover, A more detailed external report document.

\textbf{Question:} How do you think the system will help you to solve current managerial problems?

\textbf{Answer:} As discussed before a visual breakdown of the data will be useful for making informed decision.

\textbf{Follow up Question:} Might there be other ways that can help you make such informed decisions?

\textbf{Answer:} Maybe if I can choose different visualizations of the data that can give a better idea of what's happening.

\textbf{Question:} To what degree would you assess the sensitivity of the data used?

\textbf{Answer:} The data we are dealing with is not extremely sensitive.

\textbf{Follow-up Question:} Since the data is not sensitive, does storing the data externally or using a cloud computing solution seem like an issue to you?

\textbf{Answer:} No, It's not going to be an issue.

\textbf{Question:} What additional features would you like to see in the system?

\textbf{Answer:} I would like to be able to filter the data myself and produce different visuals from the filtered data.

\textbf{Question:} Should the interface contain a dashboard of the most important data?

\textbf{Answer:} Yes, it should.

\subsubsection{Summary}
After asking the main five question, we found that since the sensitivity of data is not extremely high a cloud computing solution is going to be used, as well as the inclusion filtering capability of the data to able to exploratory analysis on the filtered knowledge-base. The dashboard shall include the ability to produce different visualizations of the data based on the filtering and the needed visual outlook. The report documents shall include a detailed outlook on the company finical state as well as projected revenue gains and loss compared to the competitors.
\subsubsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The development of dashboard that highlights important information and that it differs from dashboard used for Finance
    \item Determination of the best cloud solution for the company
    \item development of the filtering capability
    \item development of the different visualizations for the filtered according to the exploratory analysis
\end{itemize}
