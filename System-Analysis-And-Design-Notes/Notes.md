# What is a System?

> System is an interconnected components that work together to achieve a goal

- Any System:
    - Designed to perform specific and various goals and objectives for the organizations or business.
    - consists of number of processes that convert the input to output
    - Have data and information to maintain.

## Examples

An Organization may also be described as a system where all staff interact with each other to become a functional  unit that could communicate with their clients to make a complete business system.

## System Components

- Resources (Can be shared)
    - Financial Resources
    - Hardware
    - Human Resources (HR)
    - Software
    - Time 
    - Fund, Money
- Procedures/Rules
    - Defined by the organization
    - shall be followed as standard
    - Ensure full compliance with legislative requirements
- Processes/Functions
    - Operations components of the System
    - Could have feedback to improve the processes

## System Characteristics

- Input
- Output
- Process
- Feedback
    - Compares the Systems output and the system's goals
- Boundaries
- Integration
- Environment

# What is an Information system?

- Collection of interrelated components:
    - Collect 
    - Process
    - Store
    - Provide output to complete a business task.

## Examples

- Course registration
- Online Banking
- Online Order

# System Analysis and Design

> The method used by Software development companies to create information systems/Software

- The method used by Software development companies to:
    - Create information systems/software
    - Maintain SW information systems/software
        - To perform basic business functions
- Transforms a project idea into documentation and application

## System Analysis

- Understand the goals and strategies of the business to investigate the problem.
- Investigate the information system requirement then decide the requirements to serve the goals and strategies
- No Code

## System Design

- A conceptual solution that fulfills the requirements
- **NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION**

# Who is the Systems Analyst?

> The systems analyst plays a key role in _information systems_ development projects.
> The systems analyst works closely with all project team members so that the team 
> develops the right system in an effective way. Systems analysts must understand 
> how to apply technology to solve business problems. In addition, systems analysts 
> may serve as _change agents_ who identify the organizational _improvements_ needed, 
> **design** systems to implement those changes, and train and motivate others to use 
> the systems.

# What's a System/Software Development Life Cycle?

> The systems development life cycle (**SDLC**) is a conceptual model used in project management that describes the stages involved in an information system development project, from an initial feasibility study through maintenance of the completed application. **SDLC** can apply to technical and non-technical systems

Consists of five consecutive phases:

- Planning Phase
- Analysis Phase
- Design Phase
- Implementation / coding phase
- Maintenance Phase

## Planning Phase

- Answers why the information System should be built
- Determine how the project team will **go**
- Composed of:
    - Project initiation
    - Project management
- Includes:
    - Project initiation
    - ensuring feasibility
    - Project Plan & schedule
    - Obtain needed approvals

## Analysis Phase

> The analysis phase answers the questions of who will use the system, what the system will do, and where and when it will be used.

- Analysis Phase:
    - Answers the following:
        - Who will use the system
        - What the system will do
        - Where it will be used
        - When It will be used
    - The Project team in this phase:
        - Investigate any current system
        - identify improvement
        - develop a concept for the new system
    - Composed of 
        - Analysis Strategy
            - to guide project efforts
            - Analyze the current system if it exists
        - Requirements gathering
            - Leads the development of a concept for a new system
            - The concept is used to build a set of analysis models
        - System Proposal
            - Presented to Project sponsor
            - Sponsors decide if the project will continue
            Describes the basic business requirements the new system should meet.
        - Includes
            - Understanding business needs
            - obtaining functional requirements
        - Delivery:
            - Analysis
            - High-level initial design

## Design Phase

- Define the solution system and how it will operate in terms of:
    - Hardware
    - Software
    - Networks
- Define the:
    - User interface
    - Forms used
    - Reports used
- Identify:
    - Needed files
    - Needed Programs
    - Needed databases and data

## Implementation/ Coding Phase:

- The system is developed or purchased
- Is considered the longest phase.
- The most expensive phase
- Composed of:
    - System construction
        - Construction of the system
        - Testing of the system
    - Installation
        - Support installed systems
        - post-implementation review

    - Training the users 
    - Installation of the new system

## Maintenance Phase

- Is done periodically 
- Done On hardware and software
- done to debug errors
- Keep improving and upgrading:
    - e.g. add new functionality


# Systems Development Life Cycle Models

## Waterfall Model

- Traditional sequential pioneer **SDLC**
- Became the defining engineering approach to _SW_ development
- done in phases and each phase has various tasks and objectives
- Deliver complete product at the end.
- Characterized by:
    - Feedback Loops 
    - Documentation-driven
- **Advantages** (pros):
    - Provides structured approach
    - Sets requirements early
    - Easy
    - Milestone are better understood
- **Disadvantages** (cons):
    - The working version will be available late.
    - has blocking states
    - specification are
        - Long
        - detailed
        - Written in a style unfamiliar to the client

## Rapid Prototyping Model

- offers a small-scale replica working "prototype" of the product and then obtains customer feedback to refine the prototype.
- delivers a complete product at the end
- sub-phases for the prototype:
    - Establish objective $\rightarrow$ plan
    - define functionality $\rightarrow$ outline definition
    - develop $\rightarrow$ product
    - evaluate $\rightarrow$ evaluation report.
- Characteristics:
    - used in requirements phase
    - evaluated by the customer
- **Disadvantages** (cons)
    - could be discard-do not turn into a product
    - not proven
- _Recommendation_ : use the **rapid prototyping model (RAD)** in defining requirements and **waterfall** in the rest of the phases.

## Incremental Model

- requirements are broken down into multiple independent modules
- each iteration passes through 4 phases.
- deliver a portion of the product at each stage
- takes from $5 \rightarrow 25$ iteration to build a product
- **Advantages** (pros)
    - **SW** is generated quickly
    - flexible
    - less costly
    - less expensive to change requirements and scope
    - customers can respond to each building module
    - errors are easy to be identified
- **Disadvantages** (cons)
    - requires good planning and designing
    - system architecture causes problems
    - the iteration phase is rigid
    - time-consuming in debugging
- _When to use_
    - clear requirements
    - need for early releases.
    - no enough skilled engineers
    - There are hight risk features and goals
    - e.g. web applications and product based companies

## Spiral Model

- is risk-driven **SDLC** model
- is based on risk patterns that push the team to adopt one or more process models
- each phase is:
    - proceeded by
        - alternative
        - _risk analysis_: identification of potential risk is done while risk mitigation strategy is planned and finalized
    - followed by
        - evaluation
        - planning for the next phase
- steps:
    - objectives and alternative solutions determination
    - identify/resolve risks
    - develop next version
    - review and plan for the next phase
- _when to use_
    - for a project that is/has :
        - large
        - requires frequent releases
        - prototypes applicable
        - medium to hight-risk projects
        - unclear and complex requirements
    - When 
        - risk and cost evaluation is important
        - changes may occur at any time
        - long-term project commitment is not feasible due to changes in economic priorities
- **Advantages** (pros)
    - give space for customer feedback
    - fast development
    - features are added systematically
    - repeated development helps in risk management
    - cost analysis is easier due to prototype fragmentation
    - additional functionality can be done at a later stage
- **Disadvantages** (cons)
    - risk of not meeting budget/schedule
    - demands risk assessments expertise
    - should be followed strictly
    - needs more documentation
    - not good for small projects

## Agile process model

- combines:
    - philosophy
        - encourages
            - customer satisfaction
            - early incremental deliver of the software
        - small highly motivated team
        - informal methods
        - minimal software engineering work
        - development simplicity
        - people and interaction are emphasized rather than processes and tools
    - Development guidelines
        - stresses _deliver_ over _analysis_ and _design_
        - active/continuous communication between developers and customers
- Steps
    - Exploration
    - planning
    - first release (repeat) - involve customer before release
    - Producterizing (Repeat) - Increase the pace of iterations after the product is released
    - Maintenance then planning
- **Advantages** (pros)
    - High customer satisfaction
    - better at adapting to late changes in requirements
    - supports face-to-face conversation
    - better at adapting to changing circumstances
    - **SW** is delivered frequently i.e. in weeks
    - customers, developers and tester constantly interact with each other
    - could continue to move forward without fear of reaching a sudden standstill
    - gives more freedom of options and time for developers and stakeholders.
        - freedom of option given them the ability to leave important decisions until more data is available
- **Disadvantages** (cons)
    - only senior programmers can take decision in the **SDLC**
    - the project can easily get taken off track if the customer is not clear about what outcome they want
    - less emphasis on designing and documentation
    - in large project, difficult ot assess the errors
- _When to use_
    - When new changes need to be implemented

## Extreme Programming (_XP_)

- description
    - variated from the incremental model
    - controversial new approach
    - based on pair programming
    - based on the continuous integration of tasks
- steps
    - project requirements
    - stories - features that client wants to estimate cost and time
    - test cases - client select stories each build (tasks)
    - tasks
    - completion
- features
    - computers are put in the center of a large room lined with cubicles
    - client representatives works with the **XP** team at all times.
    - There is no specialization
    - There is no overall design phase - refactoring
    - After completion, the **XP** team has iteration planning meetings with the customers
    - Tasks are accepted based on customer testing

## How to select the suitable *SDLC* model?

- Each of these approaches is suitable for different projects, environment, and requirements
- e.g. **Waterfall** is good for simple projects. However, **Spiral** or **iterative** are better for large-scale projects
- **No single model is the best of all the _SDLC_ models discussed**
- To select the best model
    - know all the types of **SDLC** models
    - Assess the requirements of all the stakeholders
    - Decide on a method that best fits your needs

### Criteria for deciding on a model

- Product complexity
- Product size
- Magnitude of changes
- Frequency of changes
- Skills of the development team
- Time constraints
- Access to users

# Requirements and Requirements engineering

## Goal of Software development

- Develope quality software on time and on budge - that meets customers' real needs.
- customer needs are critical for software development
- Requirements shall be engineered and analyzed between testers, customers, designers, and implementers

## Requirements

### Definition

> Abstract description of the _services_ provided by the system and the constraints under which the system must operate. Written _understandably_ for the customers

### Requirements Specification

- Produced in form of a requirement specification document
    - A structured document that sets out the system service in detail

### Characteristics of good requirements

- Unambiguous
    - doesn't use short forms or abbreviations
    - doesn't not contain words or forms that might have a double meaning i.e.
    No need to think about a double meaning. i.e. don't make me think twice
- Verifiable
    - don't say "etc"
    - don't say "as they say, ..."
    - The arguments in the requirement should be exact.
- Concise
    - don't use run-on
    - don't use long _unnecessarily_ long sentences.
    - don't use may conjunctions
- correct
    - no Falsified information
- understandable
    - Grammatically correct
    - don't use may,will,must or can
- Feasible/realistic
    - could be applied and tested
- independent
    - don't relate requirements to each other
- atomic 
    - focusing on one point only or one element
- necessary
    - shall be needed by an stakeholder
    - shall be effective (can't go without it)
- Implementation-free (Abstract)
    - should not contain unnecessary design and implementation information
    - don't mention coding or files

### Characteristics for the Set of Requirements

- Consistent
    - No conflicts between the requirements
    - applied terminology should consistent
- Non-redundant
    - No overlap between the requirement
- complete
    - all applicable requirements should be specified

### Functional and non-functional requirements

#### Functional requirements

- Functional Requirements include:
    - Activity that the system must perform
    - Mention the process the system shall do
    - Mention the information the system shall include
    - flow directly into the creation of functional, structural and behavioral models.

#### Non-functional Requirements

- specifies
    - how the system should behave
    - system behavior constraints
- Quality attributes for a system

### Difference between functional and non-functional requirements

The difference is that _non-functional requirement_ describes **how the system works**, while _functional requirement_ describes **what the system should do**

### Requirements gathering techniques

- Observation
- Interview
- Questionnaires
- Scenario Walkthourghs
- Focus groups
- Prototypes (**RPD**)

# Information Gathering

## Interviews

> The interview is the most commonly used requirements elicitation technique. After all, it is natural

- A one-on-one dig through your user's knowledge base
- A way to collect large amounts of in-depth data quickly
- Exploring someone's knowledge and needs in-depth, one-on-one
- Ensure that you understand the real, not just the perceived need

### Planning for an interview

- Read background materials
- Establish objectives
- decide whom to interview
- Prepare the interviewee
- Decide Question types and Structures

### Structured vs Non-structured interviews

#### Structured interviews

- Strictly adhere to the use of an interview protocol to guide
- Rigid interview style
- not a lot of opportunities to probe and further explore topics
- advantageous if there is a comprehensive list of interview questions

#### Semi-structured interviews

- use an interview protocol to help guide the interview
- maintain some structure
- ability to probe the participant for additional details
- offers flexibility
- no need for several rounds as it follows a protocol

#### Unstructured interviews

- happen with few if any, interview questions
- progress in the manner of a normal conversation on some topic
- formless interview style to establish rapport
- good to discuss sensitive topics
- need to conduct several rounds of interviews
- participant's narratives maneuver the conversation away

### Recording the interview

#### Tape record

- need permission to be done
- **Advantages** (pros)
    - provide a completely accurate record
    - free the interviewer to listen and respond
    - allow better eye contact
    - allow better rapport
    - allow replay of the interview
- **Disadvantages** (cons)
    - make the interviewee nervous
    - less apt to respond freely
    - make the interviewer less apt to listen
    - difficulty to find important passages on a long tape
    - increasing costs of data gathering

#### Note taking

- **Advantages** (pros)
    - keeping the interviewer alert
    - aid recall of important questions
    - help recall important interview trends
    - show interviewer interest in the interview
    - demonstrate the interviewer's preparedness
- **Disadvantages** (cons)
    - loss vital eye contact
    - loss the train of conversation
    - make the interviewee hesitant to speak when notes are being made
    - causing excessive attention to fact and too little attention to feelings and opinions

### Questions Types

#### Open-ended

- Allow interviewees to respond how thy with any length
- interested in the breadth and depth of the reply
- **Advantages** (pros)
    - put the interviewee at ease
    - allow the interviewer to pick up on the interviewee's vocabulary
    - reflect education, values, attitudes, and beliefs
    - richness of detail
    - Avenues of further questioning
    - more interesting for the interviewee
    - allows more spontaneity
    - Makes phrasing easier for the interviewer
    - useful if the interviewer is unprepared
- **Disadvantages** (cons)
    - result in too much irrelevant details
    - possibly losing control
    - take too much time for useful information
    - potentially seems that the interviewer is unprepared

#### Close-ended

- Limit the number of possible responses
- Generate precise, reliable data which is easy to analyze
- The methodology is efficient
- requires little skill for interviewers
- **Advantages** 
    - Saving interview time
    - Easily  comparing interviews
    - Getting to the point
    - keeping control of the interview
    - covering a large area quickly
    - Getting to relevant data
- **Disadvantages**
    - Boring for hte interviewee
    - Failure to obtain rich detail
    - Missing main ideas
    - Failing to build rapport between interviewer and interviewee

#### Bipolar Questions

- Answered with a ("yes","no") or ("agree","disagree")
- Should be used sparingly

#### Probing Questions

- Elicit more detail about _previous questions_
- Purpose
    - Get more meaning
    - Clarify
    - Draw out and expand on the interviewee's

### Pitfalls

- Avoid leading questions as leading questions tend to guide interviewees into responses desired by the interviewer
    - should be avoided to
        - reduce bias
        - improve reliability
        - improve validity
- Avoid double-barreled questions as asking two questions at once
    - should be avoided
        - as interviewees may answer only one question
        - leading to difficulties in interpretation

### Questions Structuring

#### Pyramid

- Begin with detailed questions (Close-ended Questions)
- Expand by allowing generalized responses (Open-ended questions)
- Useful if
    - Interviewees need to be armed up to the topic
    - seem reluctant to address the topic

#### Funnel

- Begin with generalized questions (Open-ended questions)
- Conclude by narrowing down (Close-ended questions)
- it provides an easy, non-threatening way to begin an interview
- good when the interviewee feels emotional about the topic

#### Diamond

- Begins in a very specific way (Close-ended questions)
- Then more general issues (open-ended questions)
- Conclude (close-ended questions)
- _useful in_ keeping the interviewee's interest and attention through a variety of questions

### Phases

#### Before

- contact the interviewee and confirm the interview
- dress appropriately
- arrive a little early
- affirm that you are present

#### During

- the interview should not exceed 45 minutes to one hour
- make sure that you are understanding what the interviewee is telling you
- ask for definitions if needed
- use probing questions

#### After

##### Closing

- Always ask "is there anything else that you would like to add?"
- summarize and provide feedback on your impressions
- ask whom you should talk with next
- set up any future appointments
- thank them for their time and shake the hand

##### Report

- write as soon as possible after the interview
- provide an initial summary, then more details
- review the report with the respondent

## Joint Application Design (JAD)

> an information gathering technique that allows the project team, users, and management to work together to identify requirements for the system.

- An information gathering technique that replaces interviews with the use community.
- Allows the analyst to accomplish requirements analysis and design the UI with users in the a group setting
- used when organizational culture supports joint problem-solving behaviors

### Jad Personnel

- Analysts
- Users
- Executives
- Observers
- A scribe
- A session leader

### Advantages

- A time saver compared to traditional interviews
- Rapid development of systems
- Improved user ownership of the system
- Creative idea production is improved

### Disadvantages

- jad requires a large block of time
- If preparations are incomplete, the session may not go very well
- if the follow-up report is incomplete, the session may not be successful
- The organizational skills and culture may not be conducive to a JAD session

## Survey/Questionnaire

- Useful in gathering information from key organization members about
    - attitudes
    - beliefs
    - behavior
    - characteristics
- Questions must not be uncertain
- Apply by
    - know what you are attempting to accomplish precisely with the study
    - offer to the correct individuals
    - determine due date

### Questionnaire languages

- misunderstanding of inquiries can prompt useless and pointless answers by being
    - simple
    - specific
    - short
    - not patronizing
    - free of bias
    - avoiding objectionable questions

### Scaling

- Use measurement scales
    - scaling is the process of assigning numbers to an attribute
    - reliability of scales refers to consistency in response
    - validity is the degree to which the questions measures what the analyst intends to measure

#### Nominal scales

> Nominal scales are used to classify things in categories

#### Ordinal Scales

> Allow classification & also imply rank ordering

#### Interval scales 

- Used when intervals are equal
- There is no absolute zero
    - Meaning that the user has to classifying something, for example, as useful or not useful

#### Ratio scales

- The intervals between numbers are equal
- Have an absolute zero
    - Meaning that the user has to ability to select a ratio that is exactly zero.


### Questionnaire format

#### Fixed Format

- Consists of questions that need a variety of predefined responses
- respondents have to choose an answer from a series of answers provided
- replies from this format of the questionnaire are a lot simpler to interpret
- increasingly latent; respondents can't ive their answers

#### Free format

- Enable users to answer openly for each inquiry
- respondent enters the appropriate response in the space

## Observations

- observing
    - decision maker
    - decision maker's physical environment
    - interaction with ergonomic environment
        - all of these are important unobtrusive methods
- provides insight into what organizational members do
- confirms what has been found through other methods

### Analyst play script

- involves observing the decision-maker's behavior and recording their actions using a series of action verbs as
    - talking
    - sampling
    - corresponding
    - deciding

# DFD (Data flow diagram)

> *Graphical* representation that describes *processes* and *data movement* through out the system

## Data Structure

- is a group of smaller **structures** and **elements**
- is represented by **Algebraic notation**
    - "=" $\rightarrow$ consists of 
    - "+" $\rightarrow$ and
    - "{}" $\rightarrow$ group of elements (repetitive elements)
    - "[]" $\rightarrow$ either or elements
    - "()" $\rightarrow$ optional element

### Examples

```
Employee Data =     Employee ID +
                    Employee Name +
                    Employee Address +
                    (Employee Email) +
                    Employee Department +
                    {Employee projects} +
                    [pay method]
```

### Structural Records

- A structure my consist of elements or structural records
    - Employee Name
    - Employee Address
- Each of these must be further defined until they are broken down into their component elements

#### Example

```
Employee Name       =   First Name + 
                        (middle) Name +
                        Last name
Employee Address    =   Street +
                        (Apartment) +
                        City +
                        State +
                        Zip +
                        (country)    
```
## Logical And physical data structures

### Logical

> Shows what data the business needs for its day-to-day operations.

### Physical

> Include additional elements necessary for implementing the system

- Key fields used to locate records
- codes used to identify record status
- Transaction codes to identify different record types
- Repeating group entries
- Limits on items in a repeating group
- Password.

## Data Element

> Should be defined with **Descriptive information**, *length* and *type of data information*, *validation* and *default values*

**Elements should be defined once in the data dictionary**

Data element consists of:
- Element Id
- Name
- Alias
- Short description
- Base or derived?
- Element length
- Type of data
- Input and output formats
- Validation criteria
- default value (if it exists)
- Comments



# System Design

## Output Design

### Objectives

- Ensure the use and acceptance of the information
- Serve a specific user or an organizational purpose
- useful to user
- Provided on time
- Choose the most effective output method
- Deliver appropriate quantity of output
- Must make sure that the output is where it's needed

Relating Output Content to Method

Content of output must be considered as interrelated to the output method.
1. External Output
    - Going outside the business
    - Utility bills
    - Ads
    - Paychecks
2. Internal output
    - Stays withing the business
    - Summary reports
    - Detailed reports
    - Historical reports
    - might contain martial available on the internet


### Output Tech

1. Printers
    - Geared toward flexibility
    - Key factors
        - reliability
        - compatibility
        - support
2. Display Screen
    - Pros
        - Easy to maintain up to date
        - Result in cost savings (cost saver)
        - Might be more desirable from user's standpoint
    - Cons
        - Different screen resolution 
        - fonts
3. Electronic output
    - E-mail
    - Faxes
    - Bulletin boards
4. RSS (really simple syndication)
    - Gathers and distributes news and other content from multiple sources
    - RSS-readers can be standalone or integrated with a browser
    - Efficiently organizes news and other information from a variety of sources
5. Push and pull tech (scraping)
    - Pull
        - Allows user to take formatted data from the web
    - push
        - Sends solicited or unsolicited information to a customer or client

### Bias

- Beware of the sources of bias
- design output that includes users
- Work with users so that they are informed of the bias
- Train users to rely on multiple output for conducting a (reality check) on system output
- create output that is flexible and allow user to modify limits and range

### Printed Output

- Detailed reports
    - Prints a report line for every record on the master file
- Exception report
    - print a line for all records that match a certain condition
- summary
    - print one line for a group of records that are used to make decision

#### Conventions

- contain constant information that doesn't change
- variable information vary each time the report is printed
- Paper quality, type, and size are constants and determined beforehand

#### Printed reports

- Must be well organized
- has lots of stylistic considerations
- Functional attributes

### Screen Output 

- Keep display simple
- keep the presentation Consistent
- facilitate user movement among displayed output
- create attractive and pleasing displays
- Graphical Output
    - Purpose of graph
    - Kind of data displayed
    - Audience
    - Effects on the audience of different kinds of graphical output

## Input Design

### Objectives

- Effectiveness
- Accurate
- Easy to use
- consistency
- simplicity
- Attractiveness

### Form Design

1. Easy to fill
    - Form flow
        - can minimize time and effort expended by employees in form completion
        - flows left to right, top to bottom
    - 7 sections of a form
        1. Heading
        2. identification and access
        3. Instructions
        4. Body
        5. signature and verification
        6. Totals
        7. Comments
    - Captioning
        - Line
            - caption on the same line or below
        - boxed
            - inside of box instead of a line
        - Checkoff
            - Lining up choices or alternatives vertically
        - Horizontal checkoff
            - lining up choice or alternative horizontally
        - Table
            - work well in the body of a form
        - combination
2. Meets the purpose for which they are designed
    - System analyst may use different types of specialty form for different purposes
    - Specialty forms
        - Multiple-part
        - continuos feed
        - perforated
3. Designed to ensure accurate completion
4. Attractive
    - Must draw people into them and encourage completion
    - Look uncluttered and elicit information in expected order
    - use different fonts and weight to make it more attractive and draw attention
