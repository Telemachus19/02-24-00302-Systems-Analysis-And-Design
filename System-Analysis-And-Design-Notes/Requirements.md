# Requirements and Requirements engineering

## Goal of Software development

- Develope quality software on time and on budge - that meets customers' real needs.
- customer needs are critical for software development
- Requirements shall be engineered and analyzed between testers, customers, designers, and implementers

## Requirements

### Definition

> Abstract description of the _services_ provided by the system and the constraints under which the system must operate. Written _understandably_ for the customers

### Requirements Specification

- Produced in form of a requirement specification document
    - A structured document that sets out the system service in detail

### Characteristics of good requirements

- Unambiguous
    - doesn't use short forms or abbreviations
    - doesn't not contain words or forms that might have a double meaning i.e.
    No need to think about a double meaning. i.e. don't make me think twice
- Verifiable
    - don't say "etc"
    - don't say "as they say, ..."
    - The arguments in the requirement should be exact.
- Concise
    - don't use run-on
    - don't use long _unnecessarily_ long sentences.
    - don't use may conjunctions
- correct
    - no Falsified information
- understandable
    - Grammatically correct
    - don't use may,will,must or can
- Feasible/realistic
    - could be applied and tested
- independent
    - don't relate requirements to each other
- atomic 
    - focusing on one point only or one element
- necessary
    - shall be needed by an stakeholder
    - shall be effective (can't go without it)
- Implementation-free (Abstract)
    - should not contain unnecessary design and implementation information
    - don't mention coding or files

### Characteristics for the Set of Requirements

- Consistent
    - No conflicts between the requirements
    - applied terminology should consistent
- Non-redundant
    - No overlap between the requirement
- complete
    - all applicable requirements should be specified

### Functional and non-functional requirements

#### Functional requirements

- Functional Requirements include:
    - Activity that the system must perform
    - Mention the process the system shall do
    - Mention the information the system shall include
    - flow directly into the creation of functional, structural and behavioral models.

#### Non-functional Requirements

- specifies
    - how the system should behave
    - system behavior constraints
- Quality attributes for a system

### Difference between functional and non-functional requirements

The difference is that _non-functional requirement_ describes **how the system works**, while _functional requirement_ describes **what the system should do**

### Requirements gathering techniques

- Observation
- Interview
- Questionnaires
- Scenario Walkthourghs
- Focus groups
- Prototypes (**RPD**)
